==================
Configurate Extras
==================

This section of the repository contains extra modules that provide integrations between Configurate and various libraries.

DataFixerUpper
    Integration with Mojang's `DataFixerUpper <https://github.com/Mojang/DataFixerUpper>`_ library. We have separate modules for versions 2 through 4 of the library, though new features will only be added to the module for the latest library version.

Guice
    Support for using a Guice injector to create object instances in an ObjectMapper.

Kotlin
    Extension functions to make working with Configurate on Kotlin easier.
